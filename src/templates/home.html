            <p>Machine Learning is the science of building hardware or software that can achieve tasks by learning from examples. The examples often come as {input, output} pairs. Given new inputs a trained machine can make predictions of the unknown output.</p>
            Examples of machine learning tasks include:
            <ul>
                <li> automatic reading of handwriting </li>
                <li> assisted medical diagnosis </li>
                <li> automatic text classification (classification of web pages; spam filtering) </li>
                <li> financial predictions </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We organize challenges to stimulate research in this field. The web sites of past challenges remain open for post-challenge submission as ever-going benchmarks.</p>
