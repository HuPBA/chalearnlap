            <p><b>Machine Learning</b> is the science of building hardware or software that can achieve tasks by learning from examples. The examples often come as {input, output} pairs. Given new inputs a trained machine can make predictions of the unknown output.</p>
            Examples of machine learning tasks include:
            <ul><li>automatic reading of handwriting </li>
            <li>assisted medical diagnosis </li>
            <li>automatic text classification (classification of web pages; spam filtering) </li>
            <li>financial predictions </li> </ul>
            <p>We organize challenges to stimulate research in this field. The web sites of past challenges remain open for post-challenge submission as ever-going benchmarks.</p>
